__To use__

See the comments in [worksets/Makefile](worksets/Makefile).  We highlight a few recipes here.  We use the notation `LSV(d,q,f)` to
identify the finite simplicial complex that is the quotient of an affine building as described in [EKZ] and [LSV].

**Recipe A.** Construct the `d1.txt` and `d2.txt` boundary maps for the LSV complex `LSV(3,2,1+y+y^4)`:

```
mkdir worksets/aaa
cd worksets/aaa
make -f ../Makefile/pgl-cayley-F16
```
And calculate the first homology:
```
make -f ../Makefile/dim-H1.txt
```

**Profiling**. Most of the programs are built with support for cpu profiling.  Profiling is off by default and can be toggled on and off by sending a `USR1` signal to the program.  Profile data is written to `cpu.out` and will be overwritten, so rename the files if you want to capture more than one profiling session in the lifetime of a process.

Example:
```
P=`ps -o comm,pid |grep smith |awk '{print $2}'`
kill -USR1 $P; sleep 600; kill -USR 1
go tool pprof -http : # opens browser
```
